üöõ FleetPulse Modular Design (Scalable Multi-Tenant Fleet Platform)
1. Core Architecture

Frontend (Hub App)

Built in React Native / Expo (cross-platform mobile + web).

Modular card-based UI ‚Üí dashboard built dynamically from config.

Navigation: role-aware tabs (Driver / Management / Admin).

Backend

API Gateway ‚Üí handles auth & routes to services.

Services:

Auth Service (JWT / Firebase / Auth0).

Fleet Service (company configs, users, roles).

Module Services (maintenance, training, messaging, etc.).

Database:

Multi-tenant schema (e.g. Postgres with tenant_id on every table).

Config-driven: each tenant chooses modules ‚Üí DB maps modules to tenant.

2. Modular Design

Think of modules as plugins. Each one is independent, but they can all be turned on/off per company.

Example Modules

Driver Logs

Trip logs, mileage, fuel, inspections.

Exposed via /driver-logs service.

Maintenance

Vehicle service records, reminders, overdue alerts.

/maintenance service + cron jobs.

Messaging

Internal chat / broadcast announcements.

/messaging service (push notifications + in-app feed).

Training & Compliance

Lessons, quizzes, certifications.

/training service.

Reports & Analytics

Aggregates data from other modules.

/reports service with dashboards.

3. Role-Based Access

Drivers ‚Üí only see driver-related modules (Logs, Training, Messaging).

Management ‚Üí see everything (Reports, Maintenance, Compliance).

Admins ‚Üí configure company dashboard (enable/disable modules).

4. Dynamic Hub / Cards

Cards aren‚Äôt hardcoded ‚Üí they‚Äôre generated from company config.

Example config:

{
  "companyId": "fleet123",
  "modules": [
    { "id": "driverLogs", "enabled": true, "roles": ["driver", "manager"] },
    { "id": "maintenance", "enabled": true, "roles": ["manager"] },
    { "id": "messaging", "enabled": true, "roles": ["driver", "manager"] }
  ]
}


Hub reads this config and builds the dashboard dynamically.

5. Extensibility

Add a new module? Just:

Create backend service (/fuel, /dispatch, etc.).

Create card + frontend component.

Add to company config.

No rewrite of the hub needed.

6. Tech Stack Suggestions

Frontend: React Native + Expo + React Navigation.

Backend: Node.js (NestJS/Express) or Django/FastAPI.

DB: Postgres (multi-tenant schema) + Redis (caching, queues).

Auth: Firebase Auth or Auth0 (fastest to scale).

Cloud: AWS or GCP with containerized services.

7. MVP Roadmap

Phase 1 ‚Äì Core hub + login + driver logs + maintenance.

Phase 2 ‚Äì Add messaging + training.

Phase 3 ‚Äì Reports, analytics, and dashboard builder.

Phase 4 ‚Äì SaaS packaging (multi-tenant onboarding, billing, admin portal).

‚úÖ This setup means:

Each company gets its own tailored dashboard.

Modules can evolve independently.

Scaling to ‚Äúuniversal fleet SaaS‚Äù becomes possible.
